# All Hail Chaos
A bot I developed during quarantine

## Setting up
### Database

This bot uses PostgreSQL for the database. You must have installed PostgreSQL on your machine, and then edit the credentials in `data.py`

### data.py

Just run the file `execute_me.py` and all the setup will be done

### Lavalink
To use Lavalink and the Music cog, please install Java 13 and run lavalink.bat before launching the bot (you may need to change the path to the app in the file's code). If you're not under Windows, just run these to commands :

```bash

$ cd All-Hail-Chaos
$ java -jar Lavalink.jar
```

Replace `All-Hail-Chaos` by the name and path of the folder in which both files Lavalink.jar and application.yml are in.
