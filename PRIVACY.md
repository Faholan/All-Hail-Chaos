**Chaotic Bot Privacy Policy**

Data collected and used by the bot, on a per-category basis

To delete the data stored about you, contact me asking for deletion of your data - by default, some data, like custom commands and tags you created, won't be deleted, except if you explicitly ask for it to be deleted. Be aware that this process is irreversible : all data related to you will be lost with no possibility of being recovered. You can also ask for an extract of all data related to you.

**Business**

*Data collected*
- Your user id
- The last time you used the `daily` command
- The number of times you used the `daily` command in a row

*How to opt out*
No data will be collected as long as you don't use any business-related command. Using any business-related command constitutes agreement for your data to be collected

**Custom**

*Data collected*
- Your user id
- The guild id
- Time of creation of the command
- All data provided during command creation

*How to opt out*
The data is only collected when you create a command. If you don't wish for your data to be collected, then don't create a command
__Requesting deletion of your data, by default, won't delete commands you created.__

**Successes**

*Data collected*
- Your user id
- The total number of command uses (up to 1000)
- Whether or not you used certain commands

*How to opt out*
You can use the `success_optout` command to opt in or out of success data collection
Opting out won't delete already collected data, but rather stop the further collection of data.

**Tags**

*Data collected*
- Your user id
- The tag's content

*How to opt out*
Don't create a tag.
Deleting a tag will also delete all information related to it.
__Requesting deletion of your data, by default, won't delete tags you created.__


**Statistics**

*Data collected*
- The name of the command used

*How to opt out*
This data is completely anonymous. You can't opt out of this, as it cannot allow me to identify any user
__Requesting deletion of your data won't delete this data, as it isn't linked to your account in any way.__
